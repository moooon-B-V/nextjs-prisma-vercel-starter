// Extends the Playwright test with a `chapter(label, body)` step that BOTH runs
// a `test.step` (for the trace/report) AND records a `{ label, tSeconds }`
// marker on the recording timeline. On teardown the markers are written to a
// `chapters.json` sidecar in the test's outputDir + attached to the report, so
// the uploader (`scripts/upload-acceptance-video.mjs`) can ship them to the
// publish endpoint alongside the video.
//
// The acceptance spec (MOTIR-1638) imports { test, expect } from here instead of
// '@playwright/test' and wraps each user-visible phase in `chapter(...)`.

// ── Pacing: the recording is for a HUMAN (MOTIR-1772) ────────────────────────
//
// ⚠️ THE `waitForTimeout` BAN IN CLAUDE.md STILL HOLDS IN FULL. That rule
// forbids sleeping to WAIT FOR STATE, and nothing here does: a hold is only ever
// taken AFTER the spec's own authoritative signal has already proven the state
// (`waitForResponse` on a write, `expect(...)` on the rendered result). Remove
// every hold and the assertions are unchanged — a hold cannot mask a race
// because it never stands in for one. Do not "fix" this by deleting it.
//
// It exists because this lane's output is a VIDEO a person watches to accept a
// Story (Principle #18). Driven at machine speed a full five-phase Story flow
// finishes in ~5 seconds with every chapter stacked inside the first four —
// green, and useless as evidence (MOTIR-921, the incident this came from).
//
// Pacing lives HERE, on `chapter()`, and not in each spec, because `chapter()`
// is the one call an acceptance spec cannot skip: it is what produces the
// timeline markers, so a spec that wants chapters is paced whether or not its
// author thought about it. Opt-in pacing would rot on the first spec written by
// someone who had not read this comment.
