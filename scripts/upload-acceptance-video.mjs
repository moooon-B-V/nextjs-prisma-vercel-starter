// ⚠️ VENDORED FROM `motir-core` (MOTIR-1941). This file is a COPY of
// motir-core's `scripts/upload-acceptance-video.mjs`. It is not a fork: keep it
// in sync, and prefer fixing bugs upstream and re-copying over patching here.
// `tests/acceptance-video-uploader.test.ts` is vendored with it so a bad sync
// fails locally. `docs/acceptance-video.md` records WHY it is a copy — the
// short version is that motir-core's composite Action runs
// `node scripts/upload-acceptance-video.mjs`, which a composite step resolves
// against the CALLER's workspace, so the Action is not remotely invocable today.
// When that is fixed upstream, delete this copy and reference the Action.
//
// Acceptance-video uploader (Story MOTIR-1627 · Subtask MOTIR-1632; keyless auth
// MOTIR-1650) — the BYOK delivery path. After a GREEN acceptance E2E, CI runs
// this to POST the recorded video + trace + chapters to the publish endpoint
// (MOTIR-1631). Auth is KEYLESS GitHub OIDC first (a repo connected via the
// Motir GitHub App needs NO secret — the job's `id-token: write` OIDC identity
// resolves the workspace), falling back to a `MOTIR_UPLOAD_TOKEN` PAT
// (`integration` scope) for an unconnected repo. A FAILING run leaves no video,
// so this is a no-op — a red acceptance E2E publishes nothing.
//
// EVERY chaptered recording in the lane is published, each to its OWN declared
// story (MOTIR-1734). The lane holds one chaptered acceptance spec per
// user-facing story (the planner rule MOTIR-1644 / the per-story support
// MOTIR-1700), so publishing "the" recording used to drop all but one story's
// receipt — silently, on a green run. See `findRecordings`.
//
// Target STORY resolution (MOTIR-1684) — the publish is NO LONGER pinned to the
// MOTIR-1627 dogfood constant. `resolveStoryKey` picks the target in precedence
// order: (1) an explicit ACCEPTANCE_STORY_KEY (library / manual override); (2)
// the RECORDING's self-declared story — the `acceptance-story.json` sidecar the
// acceptance harness writes (authoritative for what the clip DEPICTS, so the
// self-test dogfood is never mis-attributed to an unrelated PR's story); (3) the
// PR's `MOTIR-<id>` parsed from ACCEPTANCE_PR_REF / ACCEPTANCE_PR_TITLE (the
// status-sync convention) — the publish endpoint resolves a subtask key UP to
// its parent story server-side; (4) ACCEPTANCE_FALLBACK_STORY_KEY (the MOTIR-1627
// dogfood, retained as the first instance / fallback).
//
// Env: auth is EITHER a GitHub OIDC token (auto via `id-token: write` —
//      `ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL`/`_TOKEN`) OR MOTIR_UPLOAD_TOKEN (the PAT
//      fallback) — neither present → opt-in no-op;
//      story target: ACCEPTANCE_STORY_KEY (override) / ACCEPTANCE_PR_REF +
//      ACCEPTANCE_PR_TITLE (PR-derived) / ACCEPTANCE_FALLBACK_STORY_KEY;
//      MOTIR_OIDC_AUDIENCE (default motir-acceptance-video),

/**
 * The acceptance SPECS this run is allowed to publish for — the repo-relative
 * paths of the `acceptance*.spec.ts` files the PR actually changed (MOTIR-1937).
 *
 * WHY OWNERSHIP IS THE GATE. Publishing is `supersede`-on-create: a new row for
 * a story retires the prior current one and unlinks its video so the orphan-GC
 * reclaims it (`acceptanceEvidenceService`). And the target story comes from the
 * RECORDING's own sidecar, which outranks the PR ref ({@link resolveStoryKey}) —
 * so every recording resolves to ITS OWN story no matter whose branch ran the
 * lane. With a CI lane gated only on a branch-name prefix, any ordinary code PR
 * therefore replaced the receipts of every story that has a chaptered spec:
 * measured on the MOTIR-1781 PR (run 30651989797), which republished seven
 * already-accepted stories with clips nobody watched.
 *
 * WHY NOT JUST GATE ON `main`. Because that breaks the feature. The acceptance
 * panel's approve edge is `in_review → done` (`acceptanceEvidenceService.decide`,
 * which the workflow rejects for a story that is not `in_review`), and
 * `in_review` is the PR-OPEN state — the status sync flips the card to `done` on
 * MERGE. So the receipt has to be published FROM the PR, while the story is in
 * review, or the reviewer never gets to watch-then-approve and the gate is dead.
 * MOTIR-1627 says exactly this: "when MOTIR-1627 is in_review, its acceptance
 * panel shows the video … and the story is accepted by watching its own video".
 *
 * So the right key is not the branch but OWNERSHIP: a run publishes the receipts
 * for the specs it changed, and nothing else. The story's acceptance-E2E PR
 * publishes its own story (during `in_review`, as designed); an unrelated PR
 * changes no acceptance spec, matches no recording, and writes nothing.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED. An unset / empty variable yields an EMPTY set, which publishes
 * nothing. A workflow that forgets to pass it rehearses rather than silently
 * superseding production evidence, and a local run can never touch a real story.
 *
 * Accepts newline-, comma- or whitespace-separated paths (`git diff --name-only`
 * output drops in unchanged) and normalises a leading `./`.

 *    on PR #1620: three chaptered specs, MOTIR-811 published, MOTIR-1726's clip
 *    discarded.)
 *  - If NONE carries chapters, a single un-chaptered recording is returned, which
 *    preserves the prior fallback behaviour for a non-chaptered suite (the story
 *    then resolves from the PR ref / the configured fallback).
