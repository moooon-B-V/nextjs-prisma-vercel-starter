// ⚠️ VENDORED FROM `motir-core` (MOTIR-1941; restored by MOTIR-7255, Story MOTIR-7250).
// This file is a COPY of motir-core's `scripts/upload-acceptance-video.mjs`. It is
// not a fork: keep it in sync, and fix bugs upstream and re-copy rather than
// patching here. `tests/acceptance-video-uploader.test.ts` is vendored with it so a
// bad sync fails locally.
//
// WHAT IT IS FOR: publishing THIS project's acceptance receipts from its own CI —
// the `Acceptance tests` lane runs it, through `.github/actions/upload-acceptance-video`,
// on a green pull-request run, over keyless GitHub OIDC (a Motir-hosted repository
// is App-connected at creation, so no secret is needed). The record that owns the
// mechanism is motir-core's `docs/decisions/acceptance-video.md`, its 2026-10-01
// amendment ("CI publishes again where the repository's lane carries the
// uploader"); if that amendment is ever reversed, this copy is no longer wanted.
// It was retired here on 2026-09-02 (MOTIR-4097) and restored on 2026-10-01.
//
// SYNC POINT: motir-core @ 39ee176ba9 (2026-10-01, MOTIR-7253 — the publisher restore;
// head of PR #3333's branch `parent/MOTIR-7250-ci-publishes-acceptance-receipt`,
// which is squash-merged to main under a different sha), carrying MOTIR-7253's
// `ACCEPTANCE_EVIDENCE_STORY_CLOSED` skip and the PR's card key as `producedByKey`.
// The BODY BELOW IS UPSTREAM VERBATIM — this header is the only local edit,
// deliberately, so the next sync is `diff` and not archaeology (MOTIR-2693).
// Record the new commit here when you re-copy.
//
// Acceptance-video uploader (Story MOTIR-1627 · Subtask MOTIR-1632; keyless auth
// MOTIR-1650) — the BYOK delivery path. After a GREEN acceptance E2E, CI runs
// this to POST the recorded video + trace + chapters to the publish endpoint
// (MOTIR-1631). Auth is KEYLESS GitHub OIDC first (a repo connected via the
// Motir GitHub App needs NO secret — the job's `id-token: write` OIDC identity
// resolves the workspace), falling back to a `MOTIR_PUBLISH_TOKEN` PAT
// (`integration` scope) for an unconnected repo. A FAILING run leaves no video,
// so this is a no-op — a red acceptance E2E publishes nothing.
//
// EVERY chaptered recording in the lane is published, each to its OWN declared
// story (MOTIR-1734). The lane holds one chaptered acceptance spec per
// user-facing story (the planner rule MOTIR-1644 / the per-story support
// MOTIR-1700), so publishing "the" recording used to drop all but one story's
// receipt — silently, on a green run. See `findRecordings`.
//
// Target STORY resolution (MOTIR-1684) — the publish is NO LONGER pinned to the
// MOTIR-1627 dogfood constant. `resolveStoryKey` picks the target in precedence
// order: (1) an explicit ACCEPTANCE_STORY_KEY (library / manual override); (2)
// the RECORDING's self-declared story — the `acceptance-story.json` sidecar the
// acceptance harness writes (authoritative for what the clip DEPICTS, so the
// self-test dogfood is never mis-attributed to an unrelated PR's story); (3) the
// PR's `MOTIR-<id>` parsed from ACCEPTANCE_PR_REF / ACCEPTANCE_PR_TITLE (the
// status-sync convention) — the publish endpoint resolves a subtask key UP to
// its parent story server-side; (4) ACCEPTANCE_FALLBACK_STORY_KEY (the MOTIR-1627
// dogfood, retained as the first instance / fallback).
//
// Env: auth is EITHER a GitHub OIDC token (auto via `id-token: write` —
//      `ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL`/`_TOKEN`) OR MOTIR_PUBLISH_TOKEN (the PAT
//      fallback for a repo with no App connection) — neither present → a named
//      no-op that exits 0;
//      story target: ACCEPTANCE_STORY_KEY (override) / ACCEPTANCE_PR_REF +
//      ACCEPTANCE_PR_TITLE (PR-derived) / ACCEPTANCE_FALLBACK_STORY_KEY;
//      MOTIR_OIDC_AUDIENCE (default motir-acceptance-video),
//      MOTIR_BASE_URL (default https://app.motir.co),
//      ACCEPTANCE_MAX_ARTIFACT_BYTES (the publish target's per-file cap the
//      up-front size gate measures against — default 100 MB, MOTIR-1911),
//      ACCEPTANCE_OUTPUT_DIR (default out/playwright-output-acceptance),

/**
 * The acceptance SPECS this run is allowed to publish for — the repo-relative
 * paths of the `acceptance*.spec.ts` files the PR actually changed (MOTIR-1937).
 *
 * WHY OWNERSHIP IS THE GATE. Publishing is `supersede`-on-create: a new row for
 * a story retires the prior current one and unlinks its video so the orphan-GC
 * reclaims it (`acceptanceEvidenceService`). And the target story comes from the
 * RECORDING's own sidecar, which outranks the PR ref ({@link resolveStoryKey}) —
 * so every recording resolves to ITS OWN story no matter whose branch ran the
 * lane. With a CI lane gated only on a branch-name prefix, any ordinary code PR
 * therefore replaced the receipts of every story that has a chaptered spec:
 * measured on the MOTIR-1781 PR (run 30651989797), which republished seven
 * already-accepted stories with clips nobody watched.
 *
 * WHY NOT JUST GATE ON `main`. Because that breaks the feature. The acceptance
 * panel's approve edge is `in_review → done` (`acceptanceEvidenceService.decide`,
 * which the workflow rejects for a story that is not `in_review`), and
 * `in_review` is the PR-OPEN state — the status sync flips the card to `done` on
 * MERGE. So the receipt has to be published FROM the PR, while the story is in
 * review, or the reviewer never gets to watch-then-approve and the gate is dead.
 * MOTIR-1627 says exactly this: "when MOTIR-1627 is in_review, its acceptance
 * panel shows the video … and the story is accepted by watching its own video".
 *
 * So the right key is not the branch but OWNERSHIP: a run publishes the receipts
 * for the specs it changed, and nothing else. The story's acceptance-E2E PR
 * publishes its own story (during `in_review`, as designed); an unrelated PR
 * changes no acceptance spec, matches no recording, and writes nothing.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED. An unset / empty variable yields an EMPTY set, which publishes
 * nothing. A workflow that forgets to pass it rehearses rather than silently
 * superseding production evidence, and a local run can never touch a real story.
 *
 * Accepts newline-, comma- or whitespace-separated paths (`git diff --name-only`
 * output drops in unchanged) and normalises a leading `./`.

 * no `headers` at all — the publish is not free to die on either. Hence the

 * deliberately: a presigned PUT carries only the metadata the SIGNER bound, so
 * an unbound type would let an artifact land as `application/octet-stream` and
 * be served as a download instead of a video. The flip side is that a mismatched
 * or missing header is a SIGNATURE failure — hence sending exactly
 * `target.contentType`, never a guess from the filename.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THE RETRY EXISTS, and what it is NOT a theory about (MOTIR-3313). This
 * used to be a single PUT whose first non-2xx was fatal, and on motir-core
 * PR #2237 the store answered one artifact's PUT with
 * `503 <Code>SlowDown</Code>` — twice, deterministically, on the same recording.
 * The tests had all passed; the lane went red in the publish, and Story
 * MOTIR-3232 was left holding ONE of its two receipts.
 *
 * The store's reason is NOT established, and this retry deliberately does not
 * claim to know it. What was MEASURED is that the usual suspects are not it: the
 * refused trace was 37.0 MB while a 65.8 MB trace published seconds later in the
 * same job, so it is neither size nor the MOTIR-1911 per-file cap; the publish
 * loop is sequential and the refused recording's own VIDEO had just uploaded
 * fine, so it is not a cold first write. What is defensible without a mechanism
 * is narrower and enough: **503 is by definition retryable, and sending a 37 MB
 * body over the public internet exactly once is not a reliable operation.**
 *
 * A retry cannot fix a store that refuses every attempt — and it should not. What
 * happens then depends on WHICH artifact, and is the caller's decision rather than
 * this function's: it throws either way, and `uploadAcceptanceVideo` catches the
 * TRACE (dropping it, so the receipt still lands — MOTIR-3409) while letting the
 * VIDEO propagate. `Published N of M` counts RECORDINGS and still tells the truth
 * under both.
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERY attempt logs the store's `x-amz-request-id` (MOTIR-3565) — the
 * accepted one as well as the refused, which is the half a store-side lookup
 * needs and the half we were throwing away. See `putRequestId` for why, and for
 * the one thing that must never join it in the log: `target.token` is a live
 * presigned signature and this repository's job logs are public.
 *
 * @param {'video' | 'trace'} label

  // MOTIR-1905 failed the run on ANY unwatchable clip, owned or not, reasoning
  // that pacing is a defect whoever is looking at the run can fix. That was
  // free advice while the step ran under `continue-on-error` and could not go
  // red whatever it returned. Now that it CAN (the step's `continue-on-error`
  // was removed with this change, so a lost receipt is finally visible), the
  // same rule would red-light every acceptance PR for a defect in a spec it
  // never touched — measured: MOTIR-2268's 14.5s clip sat in the lane's
  // recordings for days, so every owner of any other spec would have inherited
  // it. A run is answerable for the specs it CHANGED; the rest it rehearses.
  //
  // So: an unpublishable OWNED recording is fatal (this PR's own story just lost
  // its receipt, and this PR's author can fix it), an unpublishable REHEARSED
  // one is reported, annotated as a warning, and counted separately.
